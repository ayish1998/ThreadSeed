# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines enhancements to the StoryWeave Reddit Devvit application to improve user engagement, community features, and overall functionality. The current application provides basic collaborative storytelling capabilities, but lacks advanced features that would make it truly compelling for Reddit communities. These enhancements will transform StoryWeave into a comprehensive community storytelling platform with rich social features, content moderation tools, and gamification elements.
